                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Date and Time: </i></b> 11:00 - 12:00, Thursday, 5 December 2024 </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Speaker: </i></b> Tobias Russell, , PhD student, Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester  </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Description: </i></b> This discussion covers the challenges transgender individuals face in academia, particularly in physics, where gender imbalances and other systemic inequities still persist. This talk reflects on my experiences as a student and early-career researcher navigating social and medical transitioning in academia. Key topics include the intersection of LGBTQ+ issues with gender disparities, the importance of visibility and safety in STEM, and strategies for supporting transgender individuals. We will cover recommendations for fostering inclusivity, including respectful practices, allyship, and valuing advocacy in professional advancement. We aim to discuss advancing equity and inclusion in academic spaces. </p>

                    <h3>&#8226 Discussing UoM podcast ‘Being a disabled PGR'</h3>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Date and Time: </i></b> 11:00 - 12:00, Thursday, 7 November 2024 </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Host: </i></b> Lily Magnus, PhD student, Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Description: </i></b> In this discussion session we will listen to the UoM “Let’s talk Disability” podcast episode in parts and discuss along the way. The episode features a conversation between Professor Jackie Carter, Professor Colette Fagan (Vice-President for Research), and Laura Howard (PGR). In the episode they discuss the positive and challenging experiences Laura has faced as a disabled PGR at the University. </p>
                    
                    <h3>&#8226 Challenging barriers to science by promoting an empathetic and inclusive environment</h3>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Date and Time: </i></b> 14:00 - 15:00, Wednesday, 2 October 2024 </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Speaker: </i></b> Julia Riley, Jodrell Bank Centre for Engagement </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Description: </i></b> My role at Jodrell Bank Centre for Engagement is Head of Education and Interpretation; I’ve been working here since 2009 and have been part of the transformational journey of this public part of the Jodrell Bank site, to open it up to more people and a wider group of people to engage, enjoy and hopefully to inspire!  Accessibility and inclusion is central to our work at JBCE, encapsulated in this line within our mission: “Challenging barriers to science by promoting an empathetic and inclusive environment.” <br>
                        JBCE is a place for learning but is also essentially a visitor attraction, and with that comes a host of opportunities for providing different ways of engaging with science not available through the traditional classroom. During the session I will share some experiences of projects and strands of work we have undertaken over the years as we continue to work towards our mission.

                    <h3>&#8226 End of year EquiTea discussion</h3>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Date and Time: </i></b> 11:00-12:00, Thursday, 6th June </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Host: </i></b> Lily Magnus, PhD student, University of Manchester </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Description: </i></b> Throughout the year we have had to finish the EquiTea sessions before the discussions have come to a close – we have therefore dedicated the final EquiTea of the year to revisiting some of the topics and re-open discussions. The session is led by Lily who will give a recap of some of the talks (Emma Nichols; outreach at UoM, Tim O’Brien; Sonification, and Sheila Kanani; EDI at RAS) and will lead the open discussion – not necessarily limited to these three talks. All inputs are welcome. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>&#8226 10 years of EDI at the RAS</h3>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Date and Time: </i></b>11:00-12:00, Thursday, 2nd May </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Speaker: </i></b> <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/education-and-careers/career-case-study-sheila-kanani">Sheila Kanani MBE, Royal Astronomical Society</a></p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Description: </i></b>In this discussion, EDI officer at the RAS Sheila Kanani, highlights some of the EDI work completed or ongoing since she started her role in 2014. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>&#8226 Sounds from space?</h3>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Date and Time: </i></b>11:00-12:00, Thursday, 4th April </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Speaker: </i></b> <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/tim.obrien">Prof. Tim O'Brien, University of Manchester</a> </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b> We are used to presenting our data visually, but a graph is just a mechanism for getting data into our brains where we can think about what it means. Vision is only one sense and there’s no reason why we can’t exploit others. Touch in the form of tactile images is one approach, but sonification - the process of turning data into sound - is another. The sounds of pulsars is a classic example. Sonification can be useful for blind or partially sighted people, but also helps engage wider groups who may not be familiar with - or be actively turned off by - graphical approaches.  In this talk, I will discuss (and demonstrate) a range of sonification projects which I’ve worked on over the years. 
                </p>
                    <h3>&#8226 Attendance is Not Enough</h3>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Date and Time: </i></b> 11:00-12:00, Thursday, 7th March 2024 </p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Speaker: </i></b><a href="https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/bartletts2">Dr. Sophie Bartlett, Cardiff University School of Social Sciences and the IAU's Office of Astronomy for Education </a></p>
                    <p class="tx-ind"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) is crucial not only for cultivating a diverse STEM workforce with varied skills and expertise but also for empowering individuals to recognise their potential in STEM fields, free from biased messaging and experiences. Despite the increasing prevalence of EDI initiatives and widening participation efforts, the assessment of their impact often does not reflect implementation. Current evaluations often focus solely on demographic reach without delving into the actual experiences of individuals. Rather than limiting impact reports to numerical data and diversity metrics, it is important we move towards measures that effectively capture and demonstrate the depth of meaningful and inclusive experiences across diverse audiences. Adhering to the principle of "do no harm", this shift requires a nuanced understanding of the experiences diverse groups have during engagement, outreach, and educational initiatives. Mere attendance should not be assumed as indicative of a positive experience. This discussion emphasises the significance of promoting EDI in STEM engagement, defining "good EDI practice," providing evidence of EDI implementation, and proposing meaningful metrics for assessing impact. The focus is on moving beyond quantitative indicators to truly understand and enhance the quality of experiences within diverse communities engaged in STEM activities.
